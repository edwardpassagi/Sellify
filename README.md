# Final Project Proposal

This repo contains the implementation for **Sellify**.<br>

## Requirements:

- React Native & Expo mobile
- MongoDB Atlas
- Node Package Manager (npm)

There are **2 main** components within this project:

1. Frontend (screens, etc.) that is stored in the project root directory with its own npm service for frontend (_excluding `/server`_)
2. Backend services (APIs, core logic) that are stored inside /server directory, with another npm service for backend.

## Testings:

### Frontend (React Native)

Manual tests are available within this project's Wiki page

### Backend (Express.js)

1. Navigate to /server
2. Run `npm test`
